# Instrument Sorter
A program to sort instrumental tracks to help create a dataset.

Put files to be sorted in `data_in` and beware that it only sorts things by underscore delimited filenames.

See the provided sample data in `data_in` and `data_out` for clarification.

The program also logs progress in case of a crash, as it is made for a lot of data to get processed.
